Chapter 1
=========
git init
git status
git add README.txt
git add -u (to add all updates)
git add A (to add new files)
git log --oneline
git diff HEAD~1..HEAD == diff HEAD~1 == diff hash1..has2

Try this:
1. Add file1 with some content
2. Add file2 withy some content
3. Stage file1 and file2 separately
     git add f1 and commit => new hash
     git add f2 and commit => new hash
4. Remove f2 and in git status you will see deleted f2
5. Do a "git add -u" to have the deletion staged
6. Now add f3 a new file. Then "git add f3" to stage it
7. Before commiting you realize f3 should have been f3.txt
8. mv f3 f3.txt. Git status will show f3 as deleted and f3.txt as new file that is untracked
9.Now we will do "git add -A" which will add an deletion and new file addition to staging area
